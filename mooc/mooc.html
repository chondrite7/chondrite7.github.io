        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>It was a project in my Shopper Marketing class during my gruduate program. We were asked to come up with a shopper communication campaign.</p>
        <h2>About Craft Beer</h2>
        <p>Craft beer is a small but fast-growing segment in the US right now. Craft beers posted double-digit sales gains in the past 3-4 years, when most other categories struggled to maintain sales after the recession. In 2011, MillerCoors created a subsidiary company called Tenth and Blake to develop and market its craft beers such as Blue Moon and Leinenkugel.  The craft beer drinker has a higher beer I.Q than the average beer drinker and uses beer language (hops, texture, color, bitterness) to differentiate between the different beers at shelf.  This beer drinker usually shops for craft beers for a special occasion, a time and place where there’s a bit of ‘show-off’ and conversation about the beer he’s holding.</p>

            <h4>Market Research</h4>

        <div class="txtright">
            <h2>Problem/Opportunity</h2>
            <P>There are so many local craft beers on the market today; it’s difficult for shoppers to differentiate. Blue Moon needs to make Mariano’s and Jewel shoppers pick up Blue Moon when they are in the mood for a craft beer.  </P>
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>Grocery shoppers will see Blue Moon as their "go-to craft beer" and purchase it over other craft beers.</p>

            <h2>Target Definition</h2>
            <p>Target new craft beer drinkers who want to participate in the craft beer craze, but aren’t sure how to get started. They want to understand craft beer language and participate in the culture, but they don’t know what they like in craft beer speak.  We call them “Timidventurers.” </p>   
        </div>

        <div class="txtright">
            <h2>Key Insights</h2>
            <p>A “timidventurer” has limited knowledge of the craft beer category but is open and willing to try new beers.  It’s easier for him to start with something he knows because the craft beer culture is intimidating.   Fun, flavorful taste is important. </br>The craft beer shopper has too many options and not enough knowledge to make a decision about a craft beer .  Jewel is not in the consideration set for people shopping for craft beers, while Mariano’s shoppers are already craft beer drinkers.</p>

            <h2>Retailer: Mariano's</h2>
            <p>Marian's has a unique focus on lifestyle. However, different from other high-end grocery stores, the prices are still kept at an affordable level. It's a place that people do more than just gocery shopping - they also hangout with friends.</br>It’s more of an upscale store, and it has an entire section devoted to craft beer.

            <h2>Shopper Strategy</h2>
            <P>We’d like our shoppers to graduate to the next level of beer. They’re going from boring, regular beers, to artfully designed, grown-up tasting Blue Moon.  You can still play beer pong, you just don’t have to do it with a gross tasting beer. <br/>

            <h2>Bar Coasters</h2>
            <p>We created bar coasters to distribute to bars throughout Chicagoland near local Mariano’s stores. The coasters encourage users to go to local Mariano’s stores to buy and/or try Blue Moon and to go to our website at Craft University to learn about Craft beer and current contests.</p>

            <h2>iPad Quiz at Craft Beer Section</h2>
            <p>As Mariano’s shoppers walk into the overwhelming craft beer section, they can take this iPad quiz, which will be located near the Blue Moon presentation, to decide which beer they want.</br>After answering a few short questions, we’ll tell the consumer about the type of Blue Moon they’d likely be interested in based on their answers. It will be simple and convenient for them to pick up the beer without too much confusion on what to buy.

            <h2>Aisle Invaders</h2>
            <p>We will put aisle invaders in Mariano’s craft beer section. It is in the shape of a glass of blue moon with a slice of orange, it’s really eye-catching, so it will also lead shoppers to take the ipad quiz. Also on the aisle invader, there’s basic craft beer knowledge and food pairing suggestion. which will Provide beneficial information to shoppers at the point of sale, and help shoppers make quick and easy decisions.</br>Aisle Invaders will be installed in Jewel Osco too.</p>

        <div class="txtright">
            <h2>Tasting Bar</h2>
            <p>In Mariano’a we will also set up a blue moon tasting station. For craft beer newbies: a chance to meet Bluemoon for the first time. For existing Bluemoon drinkers: an opportunity to try different flavors.
More importantly, shoppers that took the ipad quiz and got their result can go to the tasting bar to try his or her own blue moon. It helps prompt shoppers to make purchases later.</p>

            <h2>Social Media Photo Contest</h2>
            <p>After purchase, we want shoppers to share their drinking experience with more their beer buddies to spread word-of-mouth for blue moon. On facebook, twitter and Instagram, the blue moon official account will launch a photo contest. Tell us how you drink blue moon.</br>Winner gets the chance to recreate his drinking experience in Mariano’s tasting bar for the next week. The key of the contest is the empowerment. Shoppers would love the idea because blue moon allows them to be the decision-maker. It invites shoppers to create the beer culture together with the brand and define what blue moon means to them.</p>

            <h2>Buzzfeed Quiz</h2>
            <p>"Which beer are you?" Quiz on buzzfeed, with link on Jewel’s website. We encourage the participants to share their buzzfeed result on the social media and invite their friends to take the quiz as well. Each participant will have a unique promo code associated with his link. When a customer invites 5 friends to take the quiz, he can get an additional 5% discounts from his next Jewel’s Blue Moon purchase. The coupon has to be used within 3 days before it is expired. </p>

        <div class="txtright">
            <h2>Food Pairing</h2>
            <p>In the fruit section next to the oranges, we set up a chalk board which reads:"Don’t forget to pick up some Blue Moon with those oranges! Never had Blue Moon? It’s light, citrus-y and delicious. Learn more about it at Craft University." Because the barrier for Jewel Osco shoppers is that they don’t know Jewel carries Blue Moon and maybe they’ve never had Blue Moon. The food pairing will educate customers to drink Bluemoon with oranges for a fun experience to drink Bluemoon. It also leads shoppers to the beer session to shop. </p>
