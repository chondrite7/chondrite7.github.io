        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>This was an entrepreneur project that I did in grad school. It was also my first startup pitch to real investors. Glocal is a database-enabled business solution that helps connect local merchants and online shoppers. I played the role of the business/marketing person in a team of five.</p>

            <h2>Alex and Haley's Problems</h2>
            <P>Alex and Hailey have a final exam tomorrow. <br/>Hailey doesn't have the textbook yet, but it's checked out at the library and she doesn't have time to wait for Amazon. There are a few local bookstores, but she's not sure if they carry the book she needs. </br/>Alex, on the other hand, doesn't worry about the exam. She's more interested in finding a green dress for the traffic light party she's going to after the exam. Those branded dresses in the downtown shopping center are too expansive and not special enough for her, so she's thinking about some local designer dresses, but she has no clue where to start.</P>

            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>From the shopper's end, it is a web-browser extension that pops up local alternatives when the shopper is searching on shoppable websites. The user will be asked to share location, preferred distance, preferred price range, etc. in the extension setting to make sure the pop-up local alternative is desirable.</li>
            <li>From the local merchants' end, it is a inventory management tool that allows merchants to  update their inventories and form a collaborative database for local products. </li>
            <li>In between the web browser extension and the inventory management tool is a website which serves as an online marketplace that connects online shoppers and local merchants.</li>
