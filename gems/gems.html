        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>It was a project in my Consumer Insights class during my gruduate program. In a team of 5, we were asked to collect consumer insights on oragnic/healthy food through interviews and develop marketing strategies for Jewel Osco.</p>

            <h2>Consumer Interviews</h2>
            <P>We collected consumer data through 5 in-depth interviews on the topic of organic food and health and coded the 5 cases and drew meaningful consumer insights from it.<br/>For the purpose of understanding etic-level meanings, we segmented the interviews into two groups:
            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                <li>“Organic Wives”: women who are married, busy in their professional lives, have higher disposable income, choose organic foods, enjoy cooking and live a healthier lifestyle.</li>
                <li>“Young on the Goers”: women who are single, have a work-centered schedule, often have their meals on-the-go and struggle to live a healthy life within budget.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="txtright">
            <h2>Consumer Insights</h2>
            <p>Common themes of Organic Wives:<br/>
            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                <li>Elements of their childhood upbringing and habits influence their food tastes today </li>
                <li>They exhibit a sense of aspiration when it comes to being “healthy”</li>
                <li>They have a need for convenience given the demands of their modern lifestyle.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Common themes of Young on the Goers:<br/>
            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                <li>The transition they are going through as young adults</li>
                <li>The practical demand for convenience due to their work-centered schedule</li>
                <li>The aspiration of being healthy</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Strategic Implications</h2>
            <P>Based on the analyses of our 5 consumer interviews, we have developed a precise, strategic plan for the Jewel Osco brand to leverage the found insights, shining light on a brand new market opportunity. “Gem’s By Jewel” is a unique hybrid of a casual, quick serve restaurant, the “Fresh To Go” offerings often seen in modern convenience stores, and offers a variety of organic and natural meals that consumers desire. It also leverages the brand of a large grocery retailer that has strong B2B relationships with consumers’ favorite brands. To say that one of these mandatory attributes is an “anchor” would be misleading, as only the combination of all of them will meet the consumer’s needs as evidenced by our data. This opportunity can set Jewel apart and presents a tremendous opportunity to break into a new market. </P>

            <h2>Gem’s By Jewel</h2>
            <p>“Gem’s By Jewel” will seek to provide convenient, fast, healthy meals leveraging comforting brands that even the Organic Wives won’t feel guilty consuming; the Young On The Goers will feel a sense of achieved health aspiration, all while leveraging the idea of comfort and brand familiarity to create a casual meal experience that could easily replace 1) the need to cook for a healthy meal, and 2) the guilt that comes with eating fast food, broken meals, or snacks. </p>

            <img class="left" src="./img/menu.png"/>
        <div class="txtright">
            <p>Brand relationships would be leveraged in meals like “Baked Kraft Whole Grain Macaroni and Cheese with Oscar Meyer lean cut Turkey Bacon,” “sliced Boar’s Head smoked ham and Sargento’s low-fat Colby on sliced whole wheat,” and “Organic Mixed Greens Harvest salad with Hidden Valley Raspberry Vinaigrette, toasted walnuts and Athenos Feta”. This brand integration would set a retailer like Jewel apart from the competition, and presents an opportunity for co-marketing. Moreover, by keeping the menu small and seasonal, it keeps the price affordable, provides exciting variation by season and allows for different name brands to be featured. <br/>
