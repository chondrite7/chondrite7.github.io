        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>This project provided me the opportunity to learn what's it like to be a product manager. It was also an entry for <a href=url"http://www.brandstorm.loreal.com/">L'Oreal Brandstorm 2012</a> marketing competition. My team and I won the National Championship in China, ranked 1/237. The challenge was to design a new sub-brand for YUESAI, an established skin-care and make-up brand, to help targeting Chinese young women aged 18-25. </p>

    <div class="left">
        <h2>Market Size & Market Share</h2>
        <p>China grows nearly 8 percent annually in cosmetic and personal care consumption, which is much faster than the global average. Skincare and makeup contribute 72%. There're 100 million young ladies aged from 18 to 25 in China. The number almost equals to the population of whole Japan.</p>

    <div class="middle">
        <h2>The Trend of Affordable Luxury</h2>
        <p>And for the luxury, the products for these young ladies grow by a double digit each year in China, whereas the other countries declined. China is the youngest luxury market now. Affordable Luxury is becoming our young ladies' new appetite.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
        <h2>Middle-class Princess</h2>
        <P>The ladies we face are the generation under one child policy, they are the princess in the booming middle-class family in China. They want to be beautiful of course, but never sacrifice health. They are the college student and office novice. They like "nude makeup", and the product BB cream grows by that amazing rate within just a few years.</P>
