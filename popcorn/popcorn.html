        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>It was a class project during my graduate program. The database of the project was provided by The popcorn Factory. We were asked to conduct segmentation and customer profiling and come up with targeted tactics and messages to different segments for the purpose of optimal revenue.</p>

        <h4>Best Customer Segments</h4>
        <hr>
    <div class="left">
        <h2>Customer Identification</h2>
        <p> To identify the most profitable customers, we ran a decile analysis based on the revenue. The result proved that not all customers are equal, which provided rationale for segmention.</p>        
    </div>
    <div class="middle">
        <h2>Customer Valuation</h2>
        <p>We conducted a clustering segmentation using 3 variables: Monetary value(Revenue),Recency, and Frequency. Among the 6 segments we created, we decided that segment 5 and 6 would be our primary focus. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
        <h2>Segment Profile</h2>
        <P>We named segment 5 The Caterpillars and segment 6 The Butterflies. Because The Caterpillars are slightly lower in monetary value and in purchase frequency than our best customers, The Butterflies. We further profiled the two focus segments based on their media usage, product preference, etc.  </P>

        <hr>
        <div class="left">
            <h2>Response Model</h2>
            <p>Based on response media history data, we created a market response model to calibrate the effectiveness of different marketing tactics.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="middle">
            <h2>Objectives & Budget</h2>
            <p>We set up behavioral and communications objectives for different segments and allocated marketing budget towards each.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="right">
            <h2>Tactics & Messages</h2>
